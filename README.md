## Virginia Department Of Health (VDH) and Ames Housing -Database-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-R and Microsoft PowerBI


VDH Database Analysis and Visualization with PowerBI and R. It's a sample database I chose  and 'AdventureWorksLT2017.bak' data for analysis & visualization. The code is edited in 'R Studio' and the visualization part uses 'Microsoft Power BI' and 'R Studio.' Also, for analysis, I used MS Excel and PowerBI's query tool.
