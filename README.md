## Virginia Department Of Health (VDH) and Ames Housing -Database-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-R 


VDH Database Analysis and Visualization with R. It's a sample database. I chose 'AmesHousing.xlsx' and 'VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Vaccines-DosesAdministered.xslx' data for analysis & visualization. The code is edited, and the visualizations are presented in 'R Studio' and 'Power BI.' Also, for analysis, I used MS Excel and Power BI query tools.
