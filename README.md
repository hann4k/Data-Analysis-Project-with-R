## Virginia Department Of Health (VDH) and Ames Housing -Database-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-R 


VDH Database Analysis and Visualization with R. It's a sample database. I chose AmesHousing.xlsx data for analysis & visualization. The code is edited and the visualizations are presented in 'R Studio'. Also, for analysis, I used MS Excel.
