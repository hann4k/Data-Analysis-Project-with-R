## Virginia Department Of Health (VDH) and Ames Housing -Database-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-R 


VDH Database Analysis and Visualization with R. It's a sample database. I chose 'AmesHousing.xlsx' and VDH COVID data for analysis & visualization. The code is edited and the visualizations are presented in 'R Studio' and 'Power BI'. Also, for analysis, I used MS Excel and Power BI query tool.
